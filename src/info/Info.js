I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything
that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.

            "I first picked up a guitar when I was seven years old, waiting patiently in the showroom of Jim‚Äôs Music Store while my sister completed her lessons. Immediately I knew that this would be a lifelong obsession and outlet for me, no matter what other ventures I pursued (though my seven-year-old thought was probably closer to ‚Äúhey this is pretty cool!‚Äù).", <br></br>, <br></br>,
            "My formal training progressed through the Royal Conservatory of Music, through which I completed my grade 8 exam in classical guitar before transitioning my focus to folk, blues, and rock styles. It was around this time that I developed an interest in songwriting, inspired by the ramblings and rhymes of Bob Dylan, Mark Knofler, and many others.", <br></br>, <br></br>,
